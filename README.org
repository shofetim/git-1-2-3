** Building / Contributing
   The slides are in Racket Slideshow format:
   http://docs.racket-lang.org/slideshow/index.html 

   (Racket is a dialect of lisp, and despite the odd name is a very powerful and
   flexible language)

   You will need to install racket, and add it to your path, then to view the
   slides:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   slideshow presentation.rkt
   #+END_SRC
   or to create a PDF version of the presentation
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   slideshow --print presentation.rkt
   #+END_SRC
